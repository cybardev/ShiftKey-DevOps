# Week 2: Containerization and Orchestration with Docker and VMs

## Overview

This week we dive into containerization technologies, primarily focusing on Docker, and comparing them with traditional virtualization using Virtual Machines (VMs.) We will explore the fundamentals of containerization, its benefits, and how to effectively use Docker for application deployment and management.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of containerization and its advantages over traditional Virtual Machines (VMs).
- Create, run, and manage Docker containers.
- Write and optimize Dockerfiles for application containerization.
- Understand basic container orchestration concepts.

## Contents

- **`README.md`**: Overview and instructions for `Week 2` materials.
- **`DevOps Foundations-Session 2 Slides.pdf`**: In-person session presentation slides.
- **`Docker Practice/`**: A practice exercise (with Answer) for containerising a Python Flask API using **Docker**.

## Hands-on Practice Exercise

Complete the Docker Containerization Exercise in the `Docker Practice/` folder. This exercise will guide you through:

- Writing a Dockerfile
- Building a Docker image
- Running a containerized application
- and, Testing our running container
